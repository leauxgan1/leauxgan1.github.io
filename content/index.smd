I am a Web Developer specializing in Backend Development.

I am passionate about leveraging web technologies to make information and community more accessible and improve users' experiences on the web!

## Experience & Education

I have graduated from the California State University of Fullerton with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science

I have the most experience with web technologies such as Javascript and restful APIs, though I have dabbled in game development and systems-level programming.  

I am involved in some open source projects such as some examples for the [Datastar]($link.url('https://www.data-star.dev').new(true)) framework and some CLI apps. 

My most recent professional experience is in teaching Game Development virtually during my time in college.

However, I am looking for more industry experience to apply my skills and I am willing to learn new technologies and workloads to do so.

## Tooling

> Backend

My language of choice for backend development is Golang due to its readability and relative performance as well as many other great design choices.

It would be difficult to speak about backend development without bringing up the elephant in the room...

PHP!

It is undeniable that PHP is a greatly important and widely used tool in backend development and is similarly simple compared with Go.

PHP's ubiquity and rapid development draw many businesses to it, and I appreciate its community and tooling greatly.

> Frontend

Single page applications have become the most popular strategies for the frontend of most webapps, so I have a good amount of experience with:

- React
- Vue
- Solidjs
- Svelte

I do believe alternative strategies like HATEOAS have many benefits over SPAs, however, and am familiar with HTMX and Datastar for creating simple, efficient apps and avoiding frontend complexity.


> Database

I have gained a great deal of familiarity with SQL databases such as SQLite and Postgres from my personal projects.

I almost always use some form of in-memory datastore like Redis or Valkey for caching or temporary storage.

For use-cases requiring No-SQL Persistent databases, MongoDB and DynamoDB are my obvious choices which I have some experience with.
