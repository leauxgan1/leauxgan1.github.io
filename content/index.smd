> Hello there!

My name is Logan and I am a Web Developer specializing in Backend Development.

I am passionate about leveraging web technologies to make information and community more accessible and improve users' experiences on the web!

## Experience & Education

I have graduated from the California State University of Fullerton with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science

I have the most experience with web technologies such as Javascript and restful APIs, though I have dabbled in game development and systems-level programming.  

I am involved in some open source projects such as some examples for the [Datastar]($link.url('https://www.data-star.dev').new(true)) framework and some CLI apps. 

My most recent professional experience is in teaching Game Development virtually during my time in college.

However, I am looking for more industry experience to apply my skills and I am willing to learn new technologies and workloads to do so.

## Tooling

> Backend

My language of choice for backend development is Golang due to its readability and relative performance as well as many other great design choices.

I also have great experience with Python backends such as Flask and Django, as well as PHP

> Frontend

The single page application architecture has become the most popular strategy for the frontend of most webapps, so I have a good amount of experience with:

- React
- Vue
- Solidjs
- Svelte

For alternatives to SPAs, minimalist libraries such as alpine for reactivity and HATEOAS for server-side rendering are tools I tend to prefer.

> Database

I have gained a great deal of familiarity with SQL databases such as SQLite and Postgres from my personal projects.

I almost always use some form of in-memory datastore like Redis or Valkey for caching or temporary storage.

For use-cases requiring No-SQL Persistent databases, MongoDB and DynamoDB are my obvious choices which I have some experience with.
